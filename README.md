FIRMWARE FOR RUSK R002 -- PRODUCTION RELEASE
============================================

This application uses the following libraries from GitHub:

foxfire-online/RUSK-r002
foxfire-online/SPARK_EmonLib
foxfire-online/SPARK_BMP085
foxfire-online/SPARK_Si1132
foxfire-online/SPARK_Si70xx
foxfire-online/SPARK_MPU9150


QUICK START GUIDE
=================

You import the libraries above through the Build interface (https://build.spark.io/login), so login or sign up first.

Import "foxfire-online/RUSK-r002" first. Once complete, search for the RUSK-Basic.ino file, once selected you will be
given the option to "use this example".  Apply the example, and it will create a new application for you called
RUSK-BASIC.

After you have imported the example, import the rest of the libraries, and add them to the RUSK-BASIC application.

You will need all of them.

Once complete, "save" your project and "verify" the code. Upon successful verification, you have two ways of getting
the firmware into your Core/Photon.


EASY WAY -- Take note sometimes this takes a couple tries
========

You can flash it "over the air". It just works!


RELIABLE WAY -- You will need to set up the the Core/Photon command line utilities first (Node.js, dfu-util, etc)
============

Once your environment has been set up, click the "cloud" icon in the Build "code" interface to download your compiled
firmware.  The file is typically called firmware.bin (if you feel this to be too complex, you can also download a
pre-compiled copy from our website).

If you have not already done so, please register and configure your Core/Photon:

  particle setup

Next, switch to DFU mode (LED flashes yellow), and you simply "flash" your Core/Photon with the firmware:

  particle flash --usb "X:path\to\firmware.bin"
